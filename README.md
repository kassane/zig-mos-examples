# Zig language & toolchain in MOS6502 examples

Using zig [LLVM 18] + LLVM-MOS-SDK on some examples

This repository contains examples showcasing the usage of the Zig programming language
with the LLVM-MOS backend in the Zig toolchain version 0.13.0-dev (LLVM 18). These examples
aim to provide a comprehensive reference for developers interested in leveraging Zig for
MOS 6502-based development.

### Getting Started

To build and run these examples, ensure you have the Zig toolchain version 0.13.0-dev + LLVM-MOS-SDK installed.

**Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kassane/zig-mos-examples.git
cd zig-mos-examples
```

Choose the example to be built and have fun.
